		<p>We have transfers free of charge anytime to beachfront and reliable prompt taxi service to anywhere guests would like. Several guests use these facilities as currently booking.com guests from Norway without car hire, others previously from UK.</p>
		<p>Laundry is outsourced daily collections and deliveries with new laundry of excellent standard. Beth was provided with overnight service wash dry on arrival on site, as requested. Compliments, no charge, as other guests receive. Larger   loads are done by our service providers, or in future for guests   staying  three nights, as for Beth. On site wash dry is available .   24hour  wash dry iron service is now available with our new laundry   service .</p>
		<p>The pool is not heated but is around 20 degrees c at this time of year autumn. This may not suit some and we believe heated pools are not as hygienic. A   washing machine and dryer and heated pool is not included in the   property facilities listed. The villa unit has own laundry facility. </p>
		<p>Beth and husband received a complimentary upgrade by prior arrangement to the penthouse. At same price as booked for the studio, as other guests asked for the same unit they had last year .</p>
		<p>We look forward to ensuring an even better stay whenever suits you.</p>
		<p>Your kind engagement is appreciated.</p>

<p>Five star reviews on Trip Advisor are common. Many of us would rather not review than give a poor review but this makes a mockery of only five stars. We stayed in the studio which is large, light, well furnished and equipped, and very comfortable. Host Trevor has been wonderful - good advice when needed, in the background when not. Add the spectacular view and you have the best place to stay near Cape Town that we have found. Truly comfortable and relaxing. Trevor provides the breakfast food and you serve yourself in your own time, in you own studio - great way to do things.”</p>

    <p>“Wonderful place to stay while visiting Cape Town”</p>
 	<p>CBV has 3 units and we were shown all 3. Each was lovely and well decorated. My wife and I stayed in the Penthouse, a multilevel unit with the bedroom on the top floor of the entire building. The views from both our bedroom and the living/dining/kitchen area one floor below were breathtaking. We also had an outdoor patio and reflection pool as part of the unit but were unwilling to take a dip because the air and water temperature were a little on the cold side. The bed was quite comfortable as were the dining and living areas.</p>
	<p>Trevor, the owner, is a friendly and warm host, eager to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. He started off with a tour of the unit and showing how to open and close the exterior shutters on most of the doors and windows and how to operate everything. He will make your breakfast every morning but I was content to settle just for his squeezing oranges to make fresh juice while I cooked the eggs and toast. He also stocked our unit with various items I had asked be included. He provided us advice on staying safe in Cape Town, places and sights to see, and directions to wherever we wanted to go. A couple of nights he drove us to restaurants in Camps Bay and picked us up when done. I would stay at CBV again and whenever I might visit Cape Town in the future. It is a fabulous place to stay. The one caveat is that it is not for the handicapped (except possibly the studio unit) as the entire building is built on the flanks of Table Mountain and requires the navigation of multiple sets of stairs every day. However, my wife and I are still reasonably fit and occasionally hike so stairs were not a problem for us."</p>

	  <p>"We stayed in Camps Bay Villa in the penthouse for 4 nights and already planning when to come back! On the skirts of Table Mountain, with uninterrupted views of Camps Bay and Lion's Head, it just cannot get better than this!</p>
	  
	  <p>The penthouse is delightfully decorated, with a pool and a large terrace. There is also a kitchen if you wish to cook your own meals and enjoy the terrace. The place is spotless clean. Feels like your own luxury villa. </p>
	  
	  <p>What makes a difference is the owner, Trevor, who has made everything to make us feel at home, including a barbeque on the terrace! </p>
	  
	  <p>We have stayed in many luxury resorts around the world and can easily say Camps Bay Villa was top notch! </p>

<p>"We stayed in the Penthouse apartment. This is an absolutely beautiful place, with a lovely open plan bedroom/bathroom on the very top floor and a spacious living/kitchen/dining room on the lower. Absolutely a must stay place for couples who want a tranquil get away. This apartment is kept tidy with daily servicing and to the highest standards. It has been tastefully decorated throughout. It is close enough to gain access to main roads and easy access to experience the 'on the door attractions' but all whilst being very tranquil and quiet retreat from busy days. Every window offers the most GORGEOUS views and nothing beats relaxing in an infinity pool (or unwinding in a stunning bath upstairs) whilst overlooking beautiful sunsets over the bay and dancing parachutes from Lions Head. Trevor is an extremely attentive and friendly host. We were treated to excellent service and were spoilt with luxurious treats and we were made to feel very welcome. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, highly recommend it to others and will most definitely be back!"<br />
