We rented the Leisure Unity and took it on a 3 week trip across the Canadian Rockies. &nbsp;There were 2 of us and the RV had everything we needed and was thoughtfully stocked with first class everything (sheets, pots, plates, chairs, etc...). It has a great comfortable bed, nice shower, and plenty of space. &nbsp;As far as driving goes once you get used to it, it's as easy as driving a car. &nbsp;The back-up camera made getting into campsites super easy. &nbsp;We will definitely rent from Bliss again and for people thinking about taking a trip like ours for a few weeks the Unity MB is the way to go.</p><p>Bill, Sant Monica CA</p><p> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>What a Vacation!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 28 May 2018 13:39:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/6/1/what-a-vacation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5b114c4603ce64e67d9cf7c6</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>What a vacation!!!!<br />We wanted to go camping in Yosemite without roughing it.

Conrad and Derek's meticulous attention to every detail made our rental and vacation perfect. We rented for 5 days and had a wonderful time. The Leisure Van MB was fully stocked with excellent amenities and linens. A nice motor home ... very easy to drive and park. All you need to do is find a great parking spot and enjoy. Both Conrad and Derek walk you through all you need to know and in less than an hour you are on your way.<br />Flying into SFO and ferrying over to Sausalito is always fun and a great way to start the vacation. Returning was just as easy. We have rented RVs from others and would recommend Bliss above others. Thanks Derek and Conrad for the excellent Customer Service.</p><p>David, Dallas TX</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Thanks for a perfect glamping adventure!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 May 2018 13:35:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/6/1/thanks-for-a-perfect-glamping-adventure</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5b114ad7562fa7f010b02db7</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>My daughters and I rented the Free Spirit from Conrad and Derek who were wonderful!

The customer service was above expectations. The rig was perfect with everything we needed for a week long adventure. We had never spent a night in a RV and were exploring if this is something we'd want to do going forward. Most definitely we're going to do more of this! &nbsp;<br /><br />Conrad and Derek made our first time out in a RV so easy. &nbsp;It was stocked with everything top notch from great bedding to wonderful kitchen tools. &nbsp;The rig was immaculate and they showed us everything we needed to know to get started. &nbsp;What we forgot from the overview on the first day we could call them and they were ready to help us. We actually had to call one of our first evenings and they walked us through the process. &nbsp;I can't say enough good things about our experience with Bliss RV.</p><p>Lynn, Happy Valley OR</p>]]></description></item><item><title> We can't WAIT to book our trips for the summer!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Mar 2018 18:32:15 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/3/3/we-cant-wait-to-book-our-trips-for-the-summer</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5a9ae9800d9297b125412fbe</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Our family just got home last night from a four-day, three-night trip in BlissRV's Serenity and we are hooked on glamping! Derek and Conrad provided outstanding customer service throughout the entire process, from our initial inquiry about six weeks ago to our flawless return yesterday evening. They were communicative, informative, helpful, and available--both before and during our trip! It is very obvious that they pride themselves on providing a completely stress-free, indulgent experience for each and every one of their guests. The vehicle was stylishly, thoughtfully outfitted with absolutely everything a family of four could have needed for an extended weekend. I love to cook and planned every meal of our trip to be prepared in the Serenity's galley kitchen--it was so much easier to work in the space than I imagined given how efficient and well-appointed the set-up is. We slept and showered, dined and played games, listened to music and read books, all in the comfort of BlissRV's Serenity with the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park just inches outside our door. The vehicle was easy to drive up Highway 17 and park in the spot we'd reserved at the RV park. And, we were quite popular with our neighbors who all came over to check out our sweet ride! The Serenity was right at home among the big boys at the campground and equally comfortable at the In-N-Out parking lot on the way home. We can't WAIT to book our trips for the summer, and are looking forward to creating more family memories in the BlissRV Serenity!</p><p>Sarah, San Francisco CA</p>]]></description></item><item><title>They exceeded my expectation</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 21:56:45 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/1/8/they-exceeded-my-expectation</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5a53e87c652deaccaa6f1272</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>My husband Joel and I highly recommend renting an RV from BlissRV. We had such a wonderful experience this past weekend renting a Leisure Travel Van Unity Murphy Bed Sprinter Van from Conrad &amp; Derek at BlissRV. The RV was extremely well equipped with everything you can think of needing and they were of high quality as well. They exceeded my expectation. During the day when the murphy bed is up there are two wonderful lounge chairs with footrests and at night the very large almost king size murphy bed with a real mattress that is super comfy comes down. I'm very picky with beds and the mattress and linens were incredibly comfortable. We are planning on purchasing a LTV Unity RV and wanted to rent one before we make the purchase as a trial run. I feel so fortunate to have found BlissRV who rents a similar very high quality LTV Unity RV. You don't find these in a typical RV rental situation. On top of this Derek &amp; Conrad offer incredible customer service.</p><p>Julie, Park City UT</p>]]></description></item><item><title>ABOVE AND BEYOND</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 07 Dec 2017 16:58:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/1/7/above-and-beyond</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5a52516af9619a83b97be4ef</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>First I wanna talk about their impeccable customer service! Conrad and Derek were just an absolute DELIGHT to deal with, they go ABOVE AND BEYOND just to make sure you have the absolute best time during your adventure(s)! You just couldn't ask for nicer people. I've had an issue with my battery (totally my fault) and they drove all the way from Palm Springs just so they could fix it for me!<br /><br />The RV I rented genuinely felt like staying at a 5-star hotel! Clean, modern and comfy beyond belief (and quite the looker)<br /><br />It was my first time in the states (I was nervous to say the least!), and renting an RV from BlissRV (and meeting Conrad and Derek) was honestly one of the highlights of my trip. Thanks for everything guys!!<br /><br />Till next time, BlissRV!</p><p>Bader, Kuwait<br /> </p>]]></description></item><item><title>It's all true...</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 30 Nov 2017 16:54:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2018/1/7/its-all-true</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:5a524f9d71c10b6703c6df90</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>It’s all true…<br />We are among Bliss RV’s newest customers and biggest fans.<br />We recommend reading all the other rave reviews. We did before we rented the Free Spirit (2 person) Mercedes Sprinter Van. And now after completing a wonderful 10 day trip, we know it’s all true - no hype.<br />The Leisure Travel Free Spirit is super well equipped, easy to drive, nimble to get in and out of spaces and truly an “apartment on wheels.” Derek and Conrad are fantastic hosts, thinking ahead to make your adventure go smoothly and resourceful when any issue arises Why do we travel? To get away from daily routine and to explore new places / people and yes to “make memories”. So, what does it say when you get back from visiting 3 national parks for 10 days (Utah’s Zion, Bryce and also the North Rim of the Grand Canyon) and weeks later you can’t stop thinking about how much fun it was ! To us that means we had a blissful time and you will too. Try it even for a long weekend, Derek and Conrad know how to treat their clients well and make the glamping experience truly memorable.</p><p>Mony, Northern CA</p>]]></description></item><item><title>So happy to have found Bliss in Montana!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 08 Sep 2017 21:17:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2017/9/8/so-happy-to-have-found-bliss-in-montana</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:59b3083fcd0f685d6d27936e</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>From the moment I found Bliss RV using a google search to when we returned our Sprinter at the end of our trip, every aspect of our adventure could not have been better! Conrad and Derek responded and answered all our questions before we booked our trip. Once booked, they were so helpful with logistics and even purchased a gas grill for us to use on our trip.<br />The pick up at the airport was flawless and the detailed tutorial on how to operate the Sprinter was all we needed to feel like it was ours. The Sprinter was easy and comfortable to drive. it was easy to operate all the mechanics involved in RVing. The vehicle and amenities were spotless, flawless. This was our second RV adventure. If you have not experienced seeing the country in an RV, it is a must. The people you meet and the things that you are able to see and experience in an RV are not comparable to other means of travel. The trip was magical. So happy to have found Bliss in Montana! We can not wait to book our next trip with Bliss.</p><p>Karen, New Canaan CT</p>]]></description></item><item><title>OUTSTANDING</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 21:13:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2017/9/8/outstanding</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:59b307b037c581fbf86dfd59</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>We almost gave up on renting a Mercedes Sprinter-Camper until we found these guys! OUTSTANDING experience. GREAT customer service, beautiful vehicle and a fun, fun trip. We had zero experience with RVs ,so there was some angst (the owners put us at ease), but we wanted something easy to drive and maneuver. The sprinter was the perfect choice for us, self-contained while allowing us to do things impossible for a larger RV (e.g., we pulled into a small turnout on a quiet road in Yellowstone one evening and watched a wildlife show through our screen door while making dinner---Magical!). We cannot say enough good things about our experience with Bliss, and we look forward to our next trip.</p><p>Pete, Indianapolis IN</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Love you guys!!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 19 Mar 2017 17:31:21 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2017/3/19/love-you-guys</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:58cebfeb9de4bb535a021c6b</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>Our experience with BlissRV was fantastic from start to finish.

Conrad and Derek made renting an RV seamless from start to finish! First, the RV was perfect, and more well-equipped than anything we've rented from the big RV rental companies. The slide-out in this Leisure Van SS made all the difference in our enjoyment of it. Easy to drive, easy to park, a roomy rear bathroom you can actually use with comfort!

Derek and Conrad of BlissRV are the nicest guys and very professional. We are new to RV'ing and we're very intimidated with the whole process. But the guys made the entire experience very easy to get through. Our Serenity was beautiful inside and out and very easy to drive. We took the rig up to Yosemite (planned) then over to Refugio State Beach (last minute due to snow coming in). All worked out quite well.

This was the first time that we'd done anything related to an RV. Conrad and Derek made the whole thing manageable and carefree, including being on-call when we had questions. Our van (we called her Principessa) carried us around Joshua Tree and along the California coast to spectacular sites. The capacity of the Sprinter Free Spirit SS gave us complete latitude to be spontaneous. We had room to spread out, cook, lounge, yet we found her easy to drive and park in the city. With guidance from the Bliss guys we landed great campsites, too. We loved the flexibility and comfort. We will definitely do this again.

First of all, I cannot say enough about how accommodating, friendly and gracious they were. At the beginning of the trip, they dropped off the RV at our hotel in town, held our empty suitcases for us, and met us again at a different hotel outside of town at the end. Secondly, the RV was exceptionally appointed, with all of the comforts of home. I was so surprised to find things like shampoo/conditioner, camp chairs, and even a coffee grinder!! Lastly, the RV itself was really amazing. I am not much of a camper, so this trip was a compromise with my outdoorsy husband to get us to and through a National Park painlessly. I have to say, this was way better than painless - it was exceptional. We are already discussing a trip up the coast to Big Sur/Carmel, and we will certainly be renting from BlissRV again when it's time to book.</p><p>Jennifer, Williston VT</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Unforgettable and absolutely wonderful!</title><dc:creator>derek loftin + conrad lifsey</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:08:42 +0000</pubDate><link>https://blissrv.com/reviews/2016/7/24/unforgettable-and-absolutely-wonderful</link><guid isPermaLink="false">520060dfe4b044192307b383:5437e5b2e4b02667fff7a828:579558159de4bb611c831f74</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>BlissRV made our trip unforgettable and absolutely wonderful!

Reserve time after your arrival for a thorough instruction in the running of the RV, which is necessary and very helpful.
